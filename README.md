# 2DSeriousGames
This repository is part of my bachelor thesis project at TUM and contains two exciting mini-games inspired by popular mobile games, Angry Birds and Candy Crush. These games are designed to provide interactive and engaging experiences while addressing specific health topics. The first mini-game focuses on liver health, while the second mini-game is tailored to provide nutrition information for diabetes patients. Both games are combined into a main platform, allowing users to easily switch between them within one application.

## Game Descriptions

### Liver Health Game

The Liver Health Game in this repository draws inspiration from the popular mobile game Angry Birds. In this game, the player is presented with a series of puzzles where they must strategically launch their player avatar towards collectable food items. The goal is to collect all 'good' foods and avoid crashing into harmful substances for the liver. The game incorporates educational elements to raise awareness about liver health and encourages players to make healthy lifestyle choices

### Diabetes Nutrition Game

The Diabetes Nutrition Game is based on the mechanics of the famous game Candy Crush. It is specifically designed to provide nutrition information for diabetes patients. The player is presented with a grid of colorful food items, and their objective is to match similar items to score points. Each food item represents a fiber-rich food or ones with lots of added sugar. Players must make wise choices to meet the dietary requirements of diabetes patients (match fiber-rich foods to get points, avoid matching items containing lots of sugar to prevent a decrease in score). The game aims to educate players about healthy food choices and manage their sugar intake.

## Usage

1. On the main platform, you will find options to select the Liver Health Game or the Diabetes Nutrition Game.
2. Click on the desired game to start playing.
3. The Angry Birds-inspired game is a level-based game that loads the next levels automatically after successfully completing the current levels. When starting to play, the scene loads the first level which is then followed by the next level upon win.
4. The Candy Crush-inspired game is also a level-based game and has two types of levels: one limited in playtime and one limiting ones moves count. After starting the game, the player can choose between these two level types.
5. Enjoy playing the mini-games and have fun while learning about liver health and diabetes nutrition.
